Extra requirements
----------

You need an actual working bot at Telegram to get started. To do so, initiate a talk with the BotFather (lol) and follow
its instructions. More information on how to do so can be found at the amazing documentation here:

Getting everything started up
-----------

The most difficult thing to do when talking to a certain user or group is to get the chat_id, which is the actual
conversation window the bot talks to.
