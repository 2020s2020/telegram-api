Why this class?
----------

There are some pretty good alternatives around there, such as: 

[The (unofficial) SDK](https://github.com/irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk)  
[akalongman's approach](https://github.com/akalongman/php-telegram-bot)

But I wanted to study a bunch of new concepts for me: 

* PHP7
* Vagrant
* Monolog
* Guzzle
* PHP-CS

I had heard of all these great tools previously but I didn't have a nice project to work on and learn properly. So this
project was born. 

Extra requirements
----------

You need an actual working bot at Telegram to get started. To do so, initiate a talk with the BotFather (lol) and follow
its instructions. More information on how to do so can be found at the amazing documentation here:
[https://core.telegram.org/bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

Also [check here for step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/akalongman/php-telegram-bot/blob/master/README.md).

Getting everything started up
-----------

The most difficult thing to do when talking to a certain user or group is to get the chat_id, which is the actual
conversation window the bot talks to.
